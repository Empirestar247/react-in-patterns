# In brief

This cookbook targets developers who already have a basic understanding of what React is and how it works. It's not meant to be used as a complete how-to guide, but as an introduction to popular concepts and design patterns. Paradigms that more or less have been introduced by the community. It points you to thinking in an abstract way. For example, instead of talking about Flux, it talks about data flow. Instead of talking about higher-order components, it talks about composition.

The book is highly opinionated. It represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible that they may have a different interpretation around the web. Have this in mind when arguing with someone and using this book to support your point of view.

Also notice that English is not my native language.

If you are reading a printed version of this book, then feel free to use a pen ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
